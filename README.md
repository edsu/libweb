Have you ever wanted a machine readable list of URLs for library websites 
around the world? It's pretty unlikely, but if you have, read on.

This screen scraper will crawl [LIBWEB](http://lists.webjunction.org/libweb/)
and extract information about library websites around the world and 
persist it as JSON. The libraries.json file that is committed here has name,
location and the URL for 7990 libraries.

To re-crawl you will need to install [Python](http://python.org), 
[lxml](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml) and then run libraries.py
